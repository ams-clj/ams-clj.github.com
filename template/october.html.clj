We will explore the motivation for gradle, its aims and its philosophy, see a little bit of theory on how it works and finally build some examples in a live demonstration.

As an early adopter I became a clojure toolsmith working on the Vim integration – VimClojure – as well as the gradle plugin for Clojure – clojuresque.

Can you correlate conversion and number of visitors with CPU peaks? Or plan an amount of hardware you'll require to run your service in a month, or even a year? Get all that data, and start making sense of it by using a very simple toolchain."

With Clojure for about 1 year, but fell in love with it from the day one, and found ClojureWerkz together with Michael Klishin, a collection of Clojure libraries, each one of which just werkz. Also, writes boring bio blurbs for conferences.

from IT teacher in a prison to senior development positions in banking

projects for a couple of years.

Rodrigo has been doing a lot of Python stuff for the last 8 years. He
got his M.Sc. in mobile localisation, and is now studying simultaneous
localisation and mapping. Rodrigo has played around with functional
languages before, and has recently started on Clojure.
