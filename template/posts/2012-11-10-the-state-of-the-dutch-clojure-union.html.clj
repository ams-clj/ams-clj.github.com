 "We are now two weeks after the biggest " [:a {:href "/october.html"} "#OctAmsClj"] " conference we ever organized, and three full years of Clojure meetups in Amsterdam. It's time to sit back and have a look at the current status of the Clojure community in the Netherlands."]

[:p
 "Anyone who attended can testify the vibrant enthusiasm pouring out of the rooms during the October Amsterdam Clojure conference. The first full day event ever organized by our group, and the third in the " (link "#OctAmsClj" "/october.html") " series, it attracted 50 people from all over the Netherlands, with someone coming even from over the border, all enjoying the sessions, the hallway chats and the greatly successful [un]conference. The whole crowd that day was composed roughly by two thirds of newcomers, the rest part of it being evenly spread between mid- and highly skilled developers, some of which are truly Clojure professionals."]

[:p "It was earlier this year that our " (link "meetup" "http://www.meetup.com/The-Amsterdam-Clojure-Meetup-Group/") " passed the 100 registered users, which is still steadily growing on a weekly basis. While the show ups are indeed way less than that number, averaging around a dozen each month, it's still a good indication over a stable interest on Clojure from the local community."]

 "and the list could go on forever. Still, this year " [:a {:href "http://euroclojure.com/2012/"} "EuroClojure"] " conference maked the quantum leap of the language to the bigger circuit. Even more, it wasn't the only one conference dedicated solely to Clojure: we did our job with " (link "#OctAmsClj" "/october.html") " and " (link "ClojureX" "http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/clojure-exchange-2012") " is upcoming in London. The agenda is definitely getting busier, and it will hopefully boost the widespread adoption of Clojure on this side of the Ocean and ultimately in the Netherlands."]
